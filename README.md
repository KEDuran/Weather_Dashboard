# Homework Assignment 6 - Weather Dashboard App

The purpose of this homwork assignment was to build a weather dashboard that will run within a browser and use [OpenWeather API](https://openweathermap.org/api) as a third-party API to retrieve weather data for any searched city. I have included a sample screenshot for my weather dashboard at the bottom of this ReadMe markdown document.

As specified in this homework assignment's instructions, I developed the browser to meet the following requirements:

- Run in the browser with a responsive layout.
- Feature dynamically updated HTML and CSS.
- Access weather data by using the [OpenWeather API](https://openweathermap.org/api).
- Meets all acceptance criteria (included below).
- Uses `localStorage` to store any persistent data.
